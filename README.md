# Multimodal Fake News Detection on Fakeddit with BERT, ResNet, ViT and CLIP


This repository contains our Advanced AI project for multimodal fake news detection on the Fakeddit dataset.

The project implements and compares three multimodal architectures that jointly use news headlines and images:

- **BERT + ResNet-50** (text + CNN image encoder)
- **BERT + ViT** (text + Vision Transformer)
- **CLIP-based multimodal classifier** (frozen CLIP backbone + classification head)

A Streamlit demo app lets you load trained weights and classify new (headline, image) pairs into six Fakeddit-style labels.

# For Training and Implementation please Refer to README inside the folder

# Project Overview

## Why three model families?

The goal was not only raw accuracy but understanding **how fusion behaves** under **class imbalance**, **long training**, and **limited Colab GPU** memory:

- **Late fusion on logits** is modular and easy to interpret.
- **Feature-level concatenation** is more expressive but heavier and more sensitive to optimization.
- **CLIP** starts from a **pretrained joint vision–language space**, so alignment is not learned from scratch; richer fusion over embeddings can outperform simpler stacks when training is tuned.

## Task and labels

Each sample has a headline (`clean_title`) and an image. The target is one of **six** Fakeddit categories:


| Class ID | Label Name           | Description |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| 0        | **TRUE**                  | Factually accurate content based on verified information |
| 1        | **SATIRE**              | Humorous or satirical content, not meant to be taken literally |
| 2        | **FALSE CONNECTION**     | Headlines or visuals that do not accurately reflect the article content |
| 3        | **IMPOSTER CONTENT**    | Content impersonating genuine sources |
| 4        | **MANIPULATED CONTENT**  | Content that has been altered or edited to mislead |
| 5        | **MISLEADING CONTENT**   | Selective framing or missing context |

**Decision rule (all models):** predict the class with the **highest logit** among the six outputs.
### 1.2 Data Format

Each example contains:

- A textual **headline/title** in column `clean_title`.
- An associated **image** given by `image_url`, downloaded and saved as `<id>.jpg`.
- Metadata: `author`, `domain`, `subreddit`, `score`, `upvote_ratio`, `created_utc`.

The cleaned dataframe `clean_df.csv` has 13 columns:

```
author, clean_title, created_utc, domain, hasImage, id,
image_url, linked_submission_id, num_comments, score,
subreddit, upvote_ratio, 6_way_label
```

## Model 1: BERT + ResNet-50 (`bertandrestnet.ipynb`)

| Component | Choice |
|-----------|--------|
| Text | `bert-base-uncased`, `[CLS]` pooling → linear layer to 6 logits |
| Image | ImageNet-pretrained **ResNet-50** → dropout → linear to 6 logits |
| Fusion | **Element-wise `max`** over the two 6-dimensional logit vectors (per class, keep the stronger modality) |
| Loss | Weighted `CrossEntropyLoss` (class weights for imbalance) |

**Reported test performance (notebook output):** ~**76.34%** accuracy; precision/recall ~0.763.

**Properties:** Simple, interpretable late fusion; each branch can be reasoned about separately.

## Model 2: BERT + ViT (`bert_ViT_v2.ipynb`)


| Component | Choice |
|-----------|--------|
| Text | `bert-base-uncased`, `[CLS]` embedding |
| Image | `google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k` **ViT**, `[CLS]` token embedding |
| Projection | Each modality → **512-d** (GELU, LayerNorm, dropout) |
| Fusion | **Concatenate** text + image → **1024-d** → MLP classifier → 6 logits |

**Reported test performance (notebook output):** ~**76.18%** accuracy; weighted F1 ~**0.761** (see saved test report in the notebook run).

**Properties:** Stronger image representation than a classic CNN; **higher GPU use** and tighter batch-size limits; learning rate and schedule matter more. The notebook uses a combined validation score (e.g. weighted + macro F1) for model selection and logs per-class metrics for rare classes.

## Model 3: CLIP multimodal classifier v1 (`CLIPv1.ipynb`)

| Component | Choice |
|-----------|--------|
| Backbone | `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32` (`CLIPModel` in Hugging Face) |
| Embeddings | L2-normalized **image** and **text** projection vectors |
| Fusion | Concatenate **`[img, text, |img−text|, img⊙text]`** → MLP (GELU, dropout) → 6 logits |

**Training schedule (notebook constants):**

1. **Stage 1 — frozen CLIP:** train **classifier head only** for **2** epochs (higher LR on the head).
2. **Stage 2 — full fine-tune:** **unfreeze entire CLIP** for up to **6** more epochs with smaller learning rate (early stopping may cut this short).

**Reported test performance (notebook output):** **76.72%** accuracy; **weighted F1 ~0.7826** (best among the three baseline variants in this project narrative).

**Conceptual progression:** ResNet uses **late logit fusion**; ViT uses **early feature concatenation**; CLIP v1 adds **interaction-aware** features (difference and product) on top of a **shared pretrained** embedding space.

---

## Model 4: CLIP multimodal classifier v2 (`CLIPv2_1.ipynb`)

CLIP v2 refines the setup for **imbalance** and **generalization**. Highlights from the notebook:

- **Offline augmentation** for underrepresented classes (e.g. 3, 4, 5): `RandomResizedCrop`, horizontal flip, `ColorJitter`, small `RandomRotation`; augmented images saved and merged into training metadata (`is_augmented` flag).
- **Balanced class weights** via `sklearn.utils.class_weight.compute_class_weight`.
- **`CrossEntropyLoss` with label smoothing** (0.1 in the notebook).
- **`WeightedRandomSampler`** for training batches.
- **Staged training:** **2** epochs **head-only**, then **unfreeze top transformer blocks** (last **2** vision + **2** text layers by default) for **top-layer** fine-tuning with reduced LRs—not full-model unfreeze from step one like v1’s second stage.
- Classifier adds **LayerNorm** on the fused 4×projection-dim vector (see `Fakeddit-WebApp/CLIPv2/Model.py`).

**Reported test performance (notebook output):** **83.22%** accuracy; weighted F1 ~**0.83**; macro F1 ~**0.74**.
